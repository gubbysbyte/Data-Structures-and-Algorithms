# Data Structures and Algorithms

This directory contains C++ implementations of various algorithms and data structures.

## Dynamic Programming

The `Dynamic Programming` folder contains solutions to classic DP problems:

*   **0/1 Knapsack Problem** (`knapsack.cpp`): Maximizing value in a knapsack with weight capacity.
*   **Subset Sum** (`subsetSum.cpp`): Determining if a subset exists with a specific sum.
*   **Equal Sum Partition** (`equalSumPartition.cpp`): Checking if an array can be split into two equal sum subsets.
*   **Count of Subsets** (`CountOfSubset.cpp`): Counting subsets that sum to a target.
*   **Minimum Subset Sum Difference** (`minSubsetDiff.cpp`): Minimizing the difference between two subset sums.
*   **Count of Subsets with Difference** (`CountOfMinSubsetDiff.cpp`): Counting subsets with a specific difference.

Each file includes a `Solution` class with recursive and memoized approaches.
